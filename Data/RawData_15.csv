However, I think this is more of a physical and bodily understanding of gender. I've ticked man, because it does apply, but I think it applies more physically than anything else. I suppose this option was there more for transsexual people / transitioning people, who would identify solely as the opposite sex-based binary to the one they were assigned at birth. For non-binary people though this option could pose a bit of a difficult question, because I think one can identify as male sometimes and female sometimes, because they are internal 'gender' terms. Man and Woman on the other hand imply more of a constant if you're not transitioning physically. My masculinity and femininity levels fluctuate constantly, but I will always remain a man. "

Also - great job on having an 'other' space for the labels question - super useful!"

I put genderless rather than agender because I've found people treat agender as a gender in-of-itself, but I personally don't have a gender. I have no idea what it feels like to have a gender. Hope that makes sense!"

I think neopronoun users tend to be unshy of the individual angle. I understand your listing only the most popular or well-known neopronouns. One possible problem: there are a lot of pronoun sets that are similar in spelling or sound to zie/hir, which you're attempting to reflect with the inclusion of ""some variation thereof"". I can't predict how, say, a person who uses ze/zim/zir/zirs/zimself, or ze/zir/zir/zirs/zirself or xie/xir/xir/xirs/xirself, or xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself, will answer, meaning you may not count some similar pronouns, which are pretty diverse and not easily categorized. Second problem: I selected ""It/that"" and I understand the reason for grouping them together, but I do not accept ""that"" as a pronoun. My pronoun would be ""it"" in the scenario you detailed. 
Also, I don't think I've met someone who used ""that"" as pronouns, while I have met multiple people who go by ""it"". If ""that"" users are out there, us ""it"" users won't necessarily tell you about the numbers. ((Useless to this survey, but I have only informed close trans friends about the it pronouns thing, and would not go by them publicly unless perhaps online.) 
My is you're going to see a small number of people using fae/faer/faer/faers/faerself this time, a pronoun with a very short history dating back to a single person which now has a bit of usage. Some people raised a fuss over ""cutesy pronouns"" which recalled mythical creatures. Personally, I think fae pronouns are cute and I know someone in real life who would use them but for faer self-consciousness. 
Another write-in I'm thinking will be relatively popular is xe/xem/xyr. There have been a couple campaigns about gender pronouns which included these. I think they're neat!"

This entire thing is completely reliant on western non-binary identities and when results are published it should acknowledge that. There is no room here for people who speak other languages or who have totally different gendered experiences and conceptions. Thus it is not actually a survey of the nonbinary community but rather of the white, western, euro-centric nonbinary community and this must be recognized. "

Before then I thought I might be a transman, but that was never quite right and I never had the words for it, not until my interest in transitioning introduced me to non-binary genders. Actually that might be wrong. I think you were the first NB person I encountered on the internet when I found your webcomic due to my polyamory. Crazy! I wonder how much longer it would have taken me to figure out my gender without your comic.  xD Well, please do keep up the good work. Thanks!"
